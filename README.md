# Rock Paper Scissors Game and Simple Calculator
This repository contains two mini projects: a Rock Paper Scissors game and a simple calculator.

# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The game randomly selects one of the three options and compares it with the user's choice. The game's outcome is determined by the rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beat Paper
- Paper beats Rock
- If both the user and the computer choose the same option, it's a draw
  
To play the game, run this.py and enter your choice when prompted. The game will display the computer's choice and the outcome of the game.

# Simple Calculator
This is a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The calculator accepts numbers up to 100.

To use the calculator, run this.py and enter the two numbers when prompted. The calculator will display the results of the four operations.

# How to Run
To run the programs, clone this repository and run this.py using a Python interpreter.
